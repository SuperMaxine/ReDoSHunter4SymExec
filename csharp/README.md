1. batch 用于批量处理正则表达式（需要手动执行，只执行验证阶段，检测阶段由Test.onlyCheck()完成）
2. csharp目前不支持通过ReDoSHunter调用。

1. `batch` is used to process regexes in batches (it needs to be executed manually, only the verification phase is executed, and the detection phase is completed by Test.onlyCheck())

2. CSharp does not support calling through ReDoSHunter at present.
